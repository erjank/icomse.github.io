      <description>Description: This workshop will provide an overview of modern advanced sampling routines, including replica exchange, umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and path sampling ethods. It will have a number of hands-on exercises running GROMACS on national supercomputing resources, and will run for 4 hours each day.
Eligibility: Graduate student, undergraduate student (with junior or senior standing), postdoctoral, early career faculty. The expectation is that students will have some experience in molecular simulation.</description>
