**Description:** This workshop will provide an overview of density functional theory and its applications in chemical and materials 
science. It will feature a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises running electronic structure codes on national supercomputing resources. 
The workshop will include a session on diversity, equity, and inclusion aspects of computational sciences. Sessions will be taught in Software 
Carpentry style, with approximately equal time divided between lectures and hands-on exercises running and analyzing simulations.
