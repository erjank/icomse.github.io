**Description**: This workshop will provide an overview of modern advanced sampling routines, including replica exchange, umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and path sampling ethods.  It will have a number of hands-on exercises running GROMACS on national supercomputing resources, and will run for 3 hours each day. The workshop will include a session on DEI aspects of computational science. The session will run 3-6 EDT / 2-5 CDT / 1-4 MDT / 12-3 PDT.  

Preliminary Schedule:
- Monday, March 20th
  - Free energy, probability, and sampling theory
  - Expanded ensemble simulations
- Tuesday, March 21st
  - Potentials of Mean Force 
  - Metadynamics 
- Wednesday, March 22nd
  - Running coupled simulations on HCP resources
  - Temperature and Hamiltonian Replica exchange simulations
- Thursday, March 23rd
  - Path Sampling
- Friday, March 24th
  - Path Sampling.

**Eligibility:** Graduate student, undergraduate student (with junior or senior standing), postdoctoral, early career faculty. The expectation is that students will have some experience in molecular simulation. 

**Registration Fee:** N/A 

**Financial Aid:** N/A

**Expected number of participants:** 50

**Equipment Needed:** Students will need laptops or desktops that can both access Zoom and have Jupyter notebooks installed.  Computing resources for performing exercises will be provided.
