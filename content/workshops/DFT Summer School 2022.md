Density functional theory (DFT) has become an essential tool for modeling chemical reactions due to its relatively low computational cost and favorable scaling with the system size. This course will present a theoretical and practical introduction to computational techniques for studying chemical catalysis and kinetics. Participants will learn practical aspects of DFT calculations and advanced topics such as the effect of solvation on chemical reactions. The open-source software CP2K will be used for the hands-on tutorial sessions.

**Eligibility:** graduate student, undergraduate student (with junior or senior standing), postdoctoral, early career faculty

**Registration Fee:** $100 (waived for participants from non-PhD granting institutes)

**Financial Aid:** Financial support is available to cover housing (in university dormitory), meals, and parking cost for all non-local participants. Limited number of travel stipends ($500) are available to help broaden participation.

**Expected number of participants:** 40

**Directions to housing:** N/A

**Where to eat:** N/A

**Equipment Needed:** Students are encouraged to bring their laptop.

**Organizers/Instructors**
  - Mike Janik, Pennsylvania State University
