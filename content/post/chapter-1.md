Applications are now open for the virtual workshop for enhanced sampling. Enhanced sampling techniques are becoming essential tools for simulating proteins, polymers, other materials ionic liquids, in applications ranging from pharmaceutical development to materials science.  This course will present an overview of fundamentals of enhanced sampling techniques, both for thermodynamics and kinetics, and practical introductions to methods PLUMED and GROMACS on high-performance computers.
