Applications are now open for the virtual workshop for enhanced sampling. Enhanced sampling techniques such as replica exchange, medtadynamics, and path sampling are becoming essential tools for simulating proteins, polymers, ionic liquids, and both soft and hard materials, in applications ranging from pharmaceutical development to materials science.  This course will present an overview of fundamentals of enhanced sampling techniques, for both thermodynamics and kinetics, and practical introductions to methods suing PLUMED and GROMACS on high-performance computers.
